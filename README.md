# SOFIA-TSAF Project Board

## Task

In a GitHub project board, a task is called an issue. Create an issue by
selecting the `Issues` tab above. Give it a title and write a description in the
big text box.

## Label

Consider adding a label or two to an issue. Currently we have these labels:
* `admin` - project administration
* `bug` - something we had finished but is not working now
* `code` - code improvements
* `database` - database development
* `documentation` - improvements or addition to documentation
* `workshop` - workshop task

## Project board

Open the project board by selecting the `Projects` tab above and then the
project board. The project board is a to-do list that currently has these
columns:

* `Consider` - tasks that seem like good ideas
* `Wishlist` - tasks that we have identified as high priority
* `Start` - tasks that were on the wishlist and should be started in the next
  days
* `In progress` - tasks that are being worked on and we can demonstrate progress
* `Done` - tasks that are completed
* `Parked` - tasks that were in progress, but other tasks have now been assigned
  higher priority

## Moving tasks on the project board

To get a task on the project board, first create the task as an issue, see
above.

Then look for a column (such as `Consider`) and select the `+` sign. Instead of
typing any text, simply type # followed by an issue number.

This will make the task visible on the project board and it can be moved between
columns as things develop.

## Assignees

By looking at tasks in the `Consider` and `Wishlist` columns, we can probably
often guess which ones of us have the expertise to carry out certain tasks, but
it might be best to only assign individuals to tasks once the task has reached
an active stage (`Start`/`In progress`) or to bring their attention to a new
task that has not been discussed before.

Most people work best when they have a small number of well-defined active tasks
:)
